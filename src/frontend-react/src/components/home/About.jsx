                        Welcome to <strong>Formaggio.me</strong>, a web application born out of a passion for both cheese and cutting-edge technology. This site was created as part of a demonstration project for developing applications using large language models (AI). My name is Pavlos Protopapas, and I am the instructor of  <strong>AC215</strong>, a course offered at <strong>Harvard University</strong>. You can find more details about the course here and learn more about me and my research here. If you’re interested in taking the course as a Harvard student you can find it in the my.harvard catalog, it is also available through <strong>Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education (DCE)</strong> for everyone else, with the next offering scheduled for <strong>Spring 2025</strong>.

                        The course is designed to provide structured experiential learning, where I, the instructor, build the AI Cheese Web App step by step during the semester. This hands-on approach helps students understand both the technical and creative aspects of AI application development.
